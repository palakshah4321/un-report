This report was prepared to the attention of the United Nations. IT analyzes the relationship between a country's GDP, its life expectancy and C)2 emissions. Our goal is to determine to what degree a country's economic strength or weakness may be related to its public health status and impact on climate population. We hypothesize that both life exp and co2 emm increase with a country's gdp.

```{r load_data, include = FALSE}
#comments to be added here and will not be included in report
gapminder_1997 <- read_csv("data/gapminder_1997.csv")
```

```{r gdp_lifeexp_1997, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder_1997) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop/1000000)+
  geom_point()+
  labs(x = "GDP Per Capita", y = "Life Expectancy", 
       title = "Do people in wealthy countries live longer?", 
       size="Population (in millions)")

```

```{r, include = FALSE}
nCountries <- gapminder_1997 %>% select(country) %>% n_distinct()
minGDP <- gapminder_1997 %>%  summarise(round(min(gdpPercap))) %>% 
  pull()
maxGDP <- gapminder_1997 %>% summarise(round(max(gdpPercap))) %>% 
  pull()
```

The above plot shows the relationship between GDPPER Capita and life expectancy for a total of `r nCountries` countries.For this set of countries, exonomic wealth ranged from a minimum of USD `r minGDP` to a max of USD `r maxGDP` per capita.
